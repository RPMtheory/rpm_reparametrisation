### Conjugacy, consistency and variational inference in recognition-parametrised models

This anonymised code package will run the numerical experiments for our simple factor-analysis-like example application.

This repository contains code for defining and training simple recognition-parametrised models (RPMs). It also contains code for our suggested new parametrisations for the inner variational parmaters of the variational inference framework for training RPMs. 

Our [experiment notebook](https://github.com/RPMtheory/rpm_reparametrisation/blob/master/run_exp_parametrisations.ipynb) will generate toy data, train a simple RPM with $J=2$ linear-Gaussian recognition factors, and store the results.

Our [visualisation notebook](https://github.com/RPMtheory/rpm_reparametrisation/blob/master/plot_exp_parametrisations.ipynb) will load the results from the experiment notebook, and create Figure 1 of our manuscript.
